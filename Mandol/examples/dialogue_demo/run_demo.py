Dialogue Demo - A slightly more complete example using a small dialogue dataset.

This demo shows how to:
1. Load dialogue data from a JSON file
2. Add dialogues to the memory system
3. Build high-level memories (entities, events, summaries)
4. Perform holistic retrieval

Usage:
    python run_demo.py
