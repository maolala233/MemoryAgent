# Prompt for inferring causal relationships between events.
EVENT_CAUSAL_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """You are a causal relationship analysis expert. Given a list of events from a conversation session, identify causal relationships where one event causes or influences another.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Output ONLY valid JSON format, no other text
- Focus on clear cause-effect relationships
- Cause must occur before effect chronologically
- Confidence score: 0.0 (weak) to 1.0 (strong)
- Only include relationships with confidence >= 0.6
- Event signatures must exactly match the original event descriptions
- Each event has a UID - use the UID for source tracking

**CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP TYPES TO CONSIDER:**
- direct_causal: Event A directly caused Event B (e.g., "led to", "caused", "triggered")
- indirect_causal: Event A contributed to or influenced Event B (e.g., "contributed to", "facilitated", "enabled")
- conditional_causal: Event A caused Event B under specific conditions (e.g., "when X happened, A caused B")
- temporal_causal: Event A preceded and caused Event B (e.g., "after", "following", "subsequently")
- emotional_causal: An emotional state caused a behavior or decision (e.g., "fear led to", "excitement caused")
- behavioral_causal: A decision or action caused an outcome (e.g., "decided to", "chose to", "action resulted in")

**EVENTS TO ANALYZE:**
